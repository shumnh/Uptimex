## What is UptimeX?

Imagine you own a website and want to make sure it's always online. Instead of trusting one company to monitor it, UptimeX uses a network of independent people (called "validators") around the world to check your website. When they confirm your site is working, they get paid in SOL cryptocurrency automatically .

**For Website Owners:**
- Add your websites to be monitored 24/7
- Get real-time alerts if your site goes down
- See detailed analytics and uptime reports
- Pay validators automatically with cryptocurrency

**For Validators:**
- Earn SOL tokens by checking websites
- Work from anywhere with just a computer and internet
- Get paid instantly for accurate monitoring
- No special skills needed - just click and check!

## üõ† Technology Used

- **Frontend**: React (modern web interface)
- **Backend**: Node.js (server technology)
- **Database**: MongoDB (data storage)
- **Blockchain**: Solana (cryptocurrency payments)
- **Authentication**: Crypto wallet login (no passwords needed)

## üöÄ How to Run This Project

```env
PORT=4000
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/uptimex
JWT_SECRET=your-secret-key-here
NODE_ENV=development
```

**Start the server:**
```bash
npm start
```
‚úÖ Server will run at: http://localhost:4000

### Step 3: Setup the Website (Frontend)

## üîí Security & Trust

- **No Passwords**: Everything uses crypto wallet authentication
- **Decentralized**: No single point of failure
- **Transparent**: All payments and checks are recorded on blockchain
- **Fair**: Smart algorithms prevent cheating and ensure fair work distribution

If you need help:
1. Check if Node.js and MongoDB are properly installed
2. Make sure your .env file has correct database connection
